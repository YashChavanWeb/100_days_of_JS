// Basics:
// Programming - set of instructions that are compiled and executed for performing a task
// Console - REPL - read , evaluate , print , loop
// to check what request is sent on reload - go to networks tab
// sources tab - shows all the files that are loaded for our website
// for calculation, javascript follows Associativity - Mul/div , add/sub (FCFS)

// Printing in javascript
console.log("Hello World")
console.log(7+6)



// Connecting HTML and JS:
// 1. We can write js in script tag after body tag of HTML
// 2. We can also connect js file to html by writing below syntax in head tag
// <script src="script.js"> </script> 



// Important:
// if we write script tag above the body, then it first renders entire js and then moves to HTML
// to avoid this we use defer keyword which completes HTML and then loads JS - DOM - interact with HTML
// <script src="script.js" defer> </script>
