// History of JavaScript

// Netscape Browser - static websites - no calculation
// Creator of Js - Brendan Eich  - in 10 days - Mocha - LiveScript
// Quote - Every application that can be written in Javascript will be written in Javascript
// ECMA - made js as standardized language - should be used by all browsers
// Chrome - own js engine (V8 engine) - more fast
// Rayn Dahl - Took V8 engine from chrome and put it into Nodejs
// Frameworks - React, Angular - For complex websites



// Interpreted or Compiled ?

// Javascript - it is interpreted language
// Interpreted Language - Line by line codes and converts - translater - slow
// Compiled Language - Software - gives binary file - that file can be executed at once
// V8 Engine - Interpreted + Compiled both - jet compiler
